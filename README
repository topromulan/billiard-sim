Simulating a pool table to learn some Java.

A 2D table with no pockets to demonstrate the conservation of momentum.

The table currently renders in text to standard output with some events or debugging output going to standard error.

Execute test3.sh in a terminal and redirect the error output. Example:

. test3.sh 2> /tmp/err

tail -f /tmp/err

At this time the balls are simple discs with no rotation or spin. The table currently renders in text mode by clearing the screen and redrawing. Debug information is going to standard error.

test3.sh sets the terminal line to character mode (min 1) and disables echo. Then it restores to original line settings after the program finishes.
