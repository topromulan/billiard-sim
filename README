Simulating a pool table to learn some Java.

The goal is a 2D table with no pockets (planned anyway) to demonstrate the conservation of momentum.

The balls are simply discs with no rotation or spin planned. The table currently renders in text mode by clearing the screen and redrawing. Debug information is going to standard error.

Future Plan: The main point is to learn Java. When this works good, plan to take a step back and reassess the design. Refactor the project and add the third dimension; get rolling, spinning, gravity, and friction going with some spheres.
